Class: CPSC-340-01: Data Structures in C++
Due: 8/23/2016

Assignment:
Create a guessing game with loops, input/output, if statements, random numbers, and functions.
- The computer proposes a number in range 1 to 1000 and the player should guess it.
- At every step of the game, a player guesses a number the computer provides feedback: whether the number is higher or lower, or met. If incorrect, the player guesses again.
- Once the game is complete, the computer invites the user for another round, where the user types y or n to indicate to continue or stop, respectively.
